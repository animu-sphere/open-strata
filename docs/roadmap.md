# Roadmap

Delivery is phased. Each phase is a usable increment, not a big-bang. Linux x86_64
is the first-class implementation target; other OS targets are modeled from the
start but may be unavailable initially.

Legend: ✅ done · 🚧 in progress · ⬜ not started

## Phase 0 — Foundation ✅

Rust workspace + `ost` CLI skeleton, machine-readable platform manifests, project
and lock schemas.

- ✅ `ost-core` / `ost-platform` / `ost-manifest` / `ost-cli` crates
- ✅ Built-in CY2025 / CY2026 / CY2027 manifests (embedded + user overlay)
- ✅ `ost platform list | show | diff`
- ✅ `ost init` (writes `openstrata.toml` + `.strata/`)
- ✅ JSON schemas for platform / project / lock
- ✅ `--json` output and deterministic exit codes

## Phase 1 — Runtime and devshell 🚧

Resolve a runtime manifest, lay it out locally, generate environment, enter a shell.

- ✅ Runtime target model + resolver (`ost-runtime`)
- ✅ Profile model + loader (`core`/`dev`/`usd`/`lookdev`)
- ✅ Environment generation (`PATH`, `LD_LIBRARY_PATH`/`DYLD_*`/`PATH`, `PYTHONPATH`,
  `CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH`, `PXR_PLUGINPATH_NAME`)
- ✅ `ost env` and `ost devshell` (bash/pwsh)
- ✅ `ost runtime pull | list | show` against a local/mock backend
- ✅ Digest-bearing runtime manifest (`runtime.json`, deterministic digest)
- ✅ `ost doctor` (host descriptor, host tool detection, runtime report;
  deterministic exit: 0 healthy / 1 issues)
- ✅ `ost runtime validate` (schema, digest integrity, layout; records outcome
  in the manifest; deterministic exit)
- ✅ `ost runtime explain` (delivered in Phase 3)
- ✅ Project lockfile `strata.lock` via `ost lock [--check]` and refreshed by
  `ost configure`: pins runtime id/variant/digest, Python ABI + `uv.lock` hash,
  resolved extensions, and validation status; fully deterministic so `--check`
  gates CI
- ⬜ Real artifact backend behind `pull` (currently mock prefix layout)
- ⬜ Richer runtime validation (Python import, native library load, USD stage
  open) once the real backend lands

## Phase 2 — CMake target build ✅

- ✅ Target model + id (`cy2026-linux-x86_64-py313-usd`) in `ost-build`
- ✅ `ost configure`: `toolchain.cmake`, `env.json`, `target.lock.json`,
  per-target `CMakePresets.json`, and a root `CMakePresets.json` that includes
  each target (verified with `cmake --list-presets`)
- ✅ `ost build`: regenerates the target then runs `cmake --preset` +
  `cmake --build`; locates ninja on PATH / `OST_NINJA` / `--ninja`; `--dry-run`
  and `--jobs`; propagates the build exit code (verified end-to-end: a real
  MSVC+Ninja build of a sample project produced and ran an executable)
- ✅ Windows MSVC-env auto-bootstrap inside `ost build`: locates `vcvars64.bat`
  (vswhere or known paths), captures the env delta, injects it into CMake/Ninja;
  `--no-vcvars` to opt out (verified: a plain shell with no developer prompt
  builds and runs an executable)
- ✅ `ost package`: `cmake --install` into a stage tree, pack to
  `dist/<name>/<version>/<target>/*.tar.zst` with per-file SHA-256, a
  content-addressed `manifest.json` (provenance + runtime digest + validation),
  and `SHA256SUMS` (verified: archive extracts and the binary runs)
- ✅ `ost validate`: checks configured / built / runtime-compatible (digest
  drift) / artifact-integrity (recomputed archive digest); skips the artifact
  check when not packaged; deterministic exit 0/1 (verified: tampering the
  archive fails the check)

## Phase 3 — OpenUSD / MaterialX profiles ✅

- ✅ OpenUSD extension family with feature sets (core/python/imaging/materialx/…)
  and MaterialX, in the new `ost-extension` crate (embedded + overlay loader)
- ✅ Capability resolver: capability → providing extension + feature, pulling in
  transitive extensions (usd-materialx → openusd[materialx] → materialx) and the
  packages each feature needs
- ✅ Compatible range vs certified build point (chosen per resolved feature set)
- ✅ `ost runtime explain` (capability → provider/extension graph, human/--json)
- ✅ `ost extension list | why | add`: list the catalog, trace why an extension
  is required by a profile (direct + transitive), and record it in
  `openstrata.toml` (idempotent, validated against the catalog)

## Phase 4 — OpenUSD plugin verification harness ⬜

Direction: [phase-4-plugin-harness.md](phase-4-plugin-harness.md). Split around
the one hard dependency — a real OpenUSD runtime (today's `runtime pull` is mock).

**4a — framework + static verification (mock backend, no real runtime):**

- ⬜ `ost-plugin` crate + Plugin Bundle contract (`openstrata.plugin.yaml`)
- ⬜ `ost plugin new` templates (C++ + `plugInfo.json` + CMake + fixtures)
- ⬜ `ost plugin inspect` (Level 0) and `ost plugin build` (reuses `ost-build`)
- ⬜ `ost plugin doctor` skeleton: Levels 0–1 + session-env preview; Levels 2+
  reported as `SKIP (needs real runtime)`
- ⬜ reports (`.strata/reports/…`) + stable error ids + JSON schema

**4b — execution levels (gated on a real OpenUSD runtime backend):**

- ⬜ real runtime backend behind `pull` (source TBD: build / prebuilt artifacts)
- ⬜ `ost plugin run` session launcher; Levels 2–5 (discovery, `usdcat`,
  Python Stage Open, golden); `ost plugin test` orchestration
- ⬜ `ost plugin view | test-view` (Level 6), `package | publish`, CI matrix

## Phase 5 — CI / Jenkins ⬜

- ⬜ CI-safe flags (`--ci`, `--no-interactive`, `--report junit|json`, `--jobs auto`)
- ⬜ Jenkinsfile template + matrix generation
- ⬜ `ost ci init | generate jenkins`

## Phase 6 — Artifact registry ⬜

- ⬜ Content-addressed artifact store (digest pinning)
- ⬜ `tar.zst` + manifest + checksums + validation report (MVP)
- ⬜ OCI layout / registry / oras transport (later)

## Phase 7 — Sessions / sandbox ⬜

- ⬜ Session metadata; `ost session start | fork | diff | discard | promote`
- ⬜ Workspace isolation; optional Linux namespace / overlayfs

## Phase 8 — AI / GPU profiles ⬜

- ⬜ GPU host detection; driver requirement checks (`ost doctor gpu`)
- ⬜ AI runtime profiles (`ai-cuda124`, `ai-rocm`, `ai-mps`, hybrid `cy2026-lookdev-ai`)
- ⬜ Jenkins GPU routing labels; smoke tests

## Python / uv (§9)

- ✅ `ost uv <args>`: runs `uv` pinned to the project's runtime Python — applies
  the runtime environment and sets `UV_PYTHON` to the runtime interpreter, so uv
  never silently substitutes a different Python (§9.3, §20.3). No-args prints the
  pinning; `uv` is located via `OST_UV` or PATH. `uv.lock` is already hashed into
  `strata.lock`.
- ⬜ Diagnose/refuse app-local `uv` deps that shadow ABI-sensitive runtime
  packages (USD/Qt/OpenEXR bindings), recommending the matching extension.

## Quality bar (applies to every phase)

- CLI errors must be actionable.
- All generated manifests must be deterministic.
- Runtime and extension identities always include version + target + digest.
- No hidden environment mutation outside `ost devshell` / `ost env`.
- Every published artifact includes provenance and validation result.
- OpenStrata must work without a preinstalled Python environment.
